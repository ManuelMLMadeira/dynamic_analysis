For our dynamic analysis implementation:

1) Run script Preprocessing.m. A choice window will pop up and the gait.xlsx or the jump.xlsx should be picked. 

2) A new pop up will appear and the gaitF1.tsv or the jumpF1.tsv should be picked. The choice must coherent with the file choosen in 1).

3) Run KinematicAnalysis.m. A choice window will pop up and the BiomechanicalModel_gait.txt or the BiomechanicalModel_jump.txt should be picked.

Note that for each of these steps, the choice of the aforementioned files will lead to the analysis of the respective motion. For the analysis of the alternative file, please repeat the steps for the other files.
